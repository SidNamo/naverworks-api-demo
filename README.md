# naverworks-api-demo

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **Java-based API demonstration** for interacting with **Naver Works APIs**.
It was created to practice making authenticated API requests, handling responses,
and understanding how Naver Works exposes its services through RESTful endpoints.

The repository focuses on **API usage examples** rather than building a complete application,
and is intended as a reference for future integrations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn how to call Naver Works APIs from a Java application
- Practice request/response handling with external REST APIs
- Understand authentication-dependent API flows
- Keep a minimal and readable reference implementation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **API Type**: REST
- **Authentication**: Naver Works API (token-based)
- **Execution**: Local execution or simple server environment
